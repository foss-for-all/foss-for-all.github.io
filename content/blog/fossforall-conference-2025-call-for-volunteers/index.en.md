The FOSS for All Conference, which will be held for the first time this year, is now only about 20 days away. We are calling for volunteers for the event day who will actively contribute to making this conference a success.

Our event is a community-driven open-source conference that is completed through everyone's participation. The participation of the organizing committee members who are voluntarily involved in preparing the event without any financial compensation, and the event day volunteers, is crucial for the success of the event.

You can apply to volunteer in the following areas:

- Registration Desk Support (managing participant check-in, merchandise sales and inventory management, handling participant inquiries, etc.)
- Speaker Support (serving as track moderators, guiding speakers on-site, providing time reminders during sessions, etc.)
- Video Support (assisting with recording session videos for each track)
- Photography and Sketch Video Support (taking photos and short video clips of participants, assisting with interview video shoots, etc.)
- Meal Support (distributing lunch, managing participant flow during lunch, cleaning up after mealtime, etc.)
- Facilities and Safety Support (assisting with event venue setup through construction work such as banners and booths the day before the event, on-site management of community and sponsor booths, assisting with participant flow management, etc.)

Volunteers will also receive special benefits:

- Complimentary ticket
- Special merchandise
- Certificate of volunteer participation

We look forward to many applications from those who wish to actively contribute to creating this first conference together. If you wish to apply, please access the link below and submit the form!
