> Note: Machine translated announcement

After the FOSS for All founding meeting, we expect that there will be people who wish to join as new members, in addition to the initial members who participated in the establishment of the organization. These may be people who could not participate at the time of establishment due to circumstances, or those who learned about the organization after its launch and promotion and now wish to join.

The new membership application process has been established, so you can now apply and join as a member by following the set procedure.

The new membership application and approval process is as follows:

1. Fill out and submit the online membership application form.
    - Please note that there are more questions than you might expect, so it may take some time to complete.
2. After the Board of Directors reviews your application, if there are no issues, an interview will be conducted.
    - Submitted applications are reviewed at the regular Board of Directors meetings held quarterly.
    - The interview schedule will be coordinated by the Board of Directors, and the interview will be based on the contents of your application.
3. The Board of Directors will review the interview results and notify you of the final membership approval decision.

If you would like to check the details and submit your membership application, please click the link below.

If you have any questions about the membership process or need help filling out the application form, please feel free to contact the Board of Directors at `contact at fossforall.org` or reach out to anyone with the `@자비로운-종신-운영자` role on Discord.
