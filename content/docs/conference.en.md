title: FOSS for All Conference
---

Organized by FOSS for All, the FOSS for ALl conference is a non-profit open source community conference that aims to be an open source conference for all, with the slogan “Free and Open Source Software for All”.

In many countries, various open source-centered non-profit conferences such as COSCUP (Taiwan) and FOSDEM (Belgium) are actively held, nourishing the open source ecosystem in their respective countries. In Korea, large global open source projects such as Python, Golang, Ubuntu, OpenStack, and Kubernetes are able to organize their own conferences by recruiting steering committees and sponsors, but individual or smaller open source projects have a hard time organizing technical exchange events. FOSS for All was started in Korea to help the local open source ecosystem by hosting a conference that brings together open source projects from various fields.

FOSS for All is open to anyone interested in open source software and communities, and will feature a variety of programs, including technical presentations, community booths, panel talks, and more, where people in various roles - developers, contributors, designers, translators, product managers, and more - can share their experiences and knowledge.

FOSS for All is made possible through sponsorship, donations, and commitments from volunteers. We keep participation fees to a minimum to make it accessible to everyone, and maintain an open and voluntary spirit of participation in line with the Free and Open Source philosophy, with no commercial objectives.
