## "Please be kind to each other"

FOSS For All is a community where people who like and are interested in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) come together to grow.  
For this to be a comfortable and enjoyable space for everyone, we need to be considerate and respectful of each other.

### Our Promises

1. **Use respectful language.**  
   Please speak with courtesy and respect to everyone, regardless of age, experience, or role.  
   Treating each other as equals makes it easier for everyone to communicate comfortably.

2. **Refrain from expressions without the other person's consent.**  
   Avoid jokes that may make others uncomfortable, nicknames used without permission, or words that may sound rude.  
   A casual remark can linger with someone for a long time.

3. **Acknowledge and embrace differences.**  
   Accept each other's different backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences with an open mind.

4. **Think twice about your words and actions.**  
   Take a moment to consider how your words and actions might affect others.  
   A caring attitude can reduce misunderstandings or hurt feelings.

5. **Respect everyone's time and effort.**  
   Value all the time and dedication put into community activities such as questions, answers, and contributions.

6. **Discrimination, harassment, and hate speech are not tolerated.**  
   Discrimination, harassment, or hateful behavior for any reason—including gender, age, race, appearance, disability, religion, or sexual orientation—will not be accepted.
